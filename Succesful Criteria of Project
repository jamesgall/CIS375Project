Successful Criteria of Project
  To make sure our project is successful we need to achieve a couple of things first. Like making sure 
  everything we need to complete our project is within budget, within a workable time frame, we must 
  make sure that our database can carry enough games, and as well as carry games people will want to 
  play. Some other things that are key is making sure that our game is user friendly for children and 
  adults, navigation of the application is easily done, doesnâ€™t take up a lot of memory, time it takes 
  to access game play for each game must not be very long, and make sure the code works correctly and 
  debugged.
