Dr. Tian,

My team, consisting of:

Muhannad Aljomaee
Ethan Borrowman
Brendan Dubach
James Gall
Blake Welch

will be modeling a smartphone app as our project.

This app will be a random game app, designed to keep people regularly entertained with new apps that may only offer a few minutes of entertainment each.

How it will work is we will have a database that is regularly communicating with the app store. It stays updated with the top rated games on the market at the time, both free and paid. The user will enter our app, press a button, and within the app it will download onto the users phone a random app. The user can play this game as long as they like and when they grow bored with it they press a button and our app gets rid of the old game and downloads a new random game.

The user will be able set specifications such as whether or not to include paid games, choose to keep the games and the progress made in the games, determine whether they want to allow download over data or only WiFi, and if their is a specific genre of game they want to play or if they will play anything.

The app may also have a social networking option, where you can see if your friends have all downloaded a game and enjoyed it.

New additions may come as development continues.

Sincerely,

James Gall
